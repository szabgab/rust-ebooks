<h1>Free Rust ebooks for Amazon Kindle</h1>

<p>
    The <a href="https://bookshelf.rs/">Rust bookshelf</a> lists a number of books about the Rust programming language.
    Most of those books are available in <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/">mdBook</a> format and are also
    available on the web as HTML pages.    
</p>

<p>
    I personally like to read books off-line on my Kindle device or even on my phone running the Kindle app.

</p>

<p>
    On this site you'll find a number of Rust-related books in epub format.
</p>

<p>
    The books are copyright their respective authors and are available under their respective licenses.
</p>

<p>
    The epub files were generated using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/mdbook-epub">mdbook-epub</a> crate.

</p>

<p>
    You can download the files from here and then you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle">send them to your Kindle</a>.
