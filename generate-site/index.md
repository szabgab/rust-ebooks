description: Ebooks about Rust programming
---

The [Rust bookshelf](https://bookshelf.rs/) lists a number of books about the Rust programming language.
Most of those books are available in [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) format and are also available on the web as HTML pages.

I personally like to read books off-line on my Kindle device or even on my phone running the Kindle app.

On this site you'll find a number of Rust-related books in epub format.

The books are copyright their respective authors and are available under their respecive licenses.

The epub files were generated using the [mdbook-epub](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook-epub) crate.

You can download the files from here and then you can [send them to your Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle).
